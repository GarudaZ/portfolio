	<h1>About</h1>
	<article>
		<p>
			I was born in Bath but have lived most of my life in the Midlands, where
			I'm currently based. I've followed my passions so far in life, that was
			what led me to study literature at university, and to work for the
			Nottingham Buddhist Centre. I love learning and building new things as
			well as playing with new technology, the journey to becoming a programmer
			has been a natural expression of that.
		</p>
		<p>
			After a couple of years of learning from apps and books, I attend a
			Northcoders bootcamp and immersed myself in coder of three months. I loved
			it, the course was intense but it really confirmed that development was
			something I found rewarding. Since then I've continued
			<a href="/projects">working on projects,</a>
			you can read more about the skills I've picked up below.
